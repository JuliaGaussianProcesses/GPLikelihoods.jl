GPLikelihoods.jl provides a collection of likelihoods to be used as building
blocks for defining non-Gaussian problems.  It is intended to be mainly
consumed by other packages within the JuliaGaussianProcesses ecosystem (such as
[ApproximateGPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/ApproximateGPs.jl))
for approximate Gaussian process regression, classification, event counting,
etc.
